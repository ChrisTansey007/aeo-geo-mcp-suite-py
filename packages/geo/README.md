# Deprecated: This folder is a stub for backward compatibility

The `packages/geo` directory has been renamed to `packages/local`.

- **GEO** now refers to Generative Engine Optimization.
- All local market and NAP data is now in `packages/local/`.
- This folder will be removed in a future release.

Update your paths and environment variables to use `LOCAL_*` instead of `GEO_*`.
