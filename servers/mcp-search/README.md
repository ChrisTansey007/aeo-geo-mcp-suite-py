**GEO = Generative Engine Optimization**

This service uses local market/NAP data from `packages/local/` (see root README for details).

- Env vars: `LOCAL_ALIASES_PATH`, `LOCAL_MARKET` (preferred). Falls back to `GEO_ALIASES_PATH`, `GEO_MARKET` for one release.
- See migration notes in the root README.
